                    <p><b>Lars Bawk</b> - Hailing from the frozen farms of the far north, Lars Bawk is the orchestrating mastermind and lead vocalist for the worldwide sensation known as Skull Phenomenon. His signature menacing style of bakawkkkking is the hallmark of Phenomenon’s brutal and punishing sound. When Bawk isn’t decrying the existential crisis that being raised exclusively for food presents, he enjoys alerting neighbors to the setting of the sun. “It’s more metal than when it rises.”</p>

                    <p><b>Gilly Thighpiece</b> - This bass played is all talons, he tears those strings up on the sunken lines he pecks for the Skull. His origins mysterious, Gilly rarely says much at all. “I speak through my instrument. And also my beak, too. Only sometimes. Like right now.” </p>

                    <p><b>Agnes Beaks</b> - Freaks on the double neck guitar, at breakneck speed. Classically trained in the style of the White faced Black Spanish forms of her breed, Agnes incorporates the raw power of metal with the speed her discipline has taught her. “Metal is alive. Well, it’s actually an inanimate material. But it lives through me. Not the building material, but the music.”</p>
